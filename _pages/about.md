To give you a brief overview of my skill set I have gained research experience working with ARIES Nainital as Senior Project Associate to collaborate with ISRO on setting up Aditya-L1 Support Cell for the first Indian Space Mission to study the Sun. I was a Junior Research Fellow for UC Berkeley SETI-Amity node at Amity University Mumbai to help set-up SETI backend at uGMRT, I have worked with RAD@home India - Citizen Science Research collaboratory in Astronomy and Astrophysics for 4+ years and have authored and co-authored my research work in national and international conferences. I have sound programming knowledge and have actively contributed to python-based projects by building core functionalities.

Soon I will be joining my PhD to continue my research interest in Radio Astronomy. I have completed Masters in Physics (2018) and a Bachelor of Science in Physics with another major subject as Computer Application (2016) from University of Allahabad. I have sound programming skills, with Machine Learning, Data Science and python based certificates in "Machine Learning by Stanford University on Coursera" (2022) and "Data-driven Astronomy by The University of Sydney on Coursera" (2019). I also attended workshop on "High Performance Computing for Astrophysics and Astronomy by SKA-India Consortium and IIT Kharagpur". I have led and have experience in working with teams in a professional environment.
