I am pursuing my PhD in the Search for Milli-Lenses ([SMILE](https://wwww.smilescience.info)) group under the supervision of [Dr Carolina Casadio](https://www.ia.forth.gr/people/Casadio). 

Our research focuses on studying Dark Matter halos within the sub-galactic scale by identifying strong gravitational lensing candidates in the milli-arcsecond regime through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

Based on my previous research experiences in Radio Astronomy and AGN, I have honed my skills in data analysis and handling large volumes of complex data sets. I gained pivotal experience that sparked my interest in radio and AGN research through [RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl/slac116) in citizen science research. This opportunity provided me with the foundational knowledge and practical skills. Later I continued to build upon my experience by taking on roles as a Junior Research Fellow for the [University of California, Berkeley SETI-Amity project](https://www.acoea.com/amity-berkeley-seti) and a Senior Project Associate funded by Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO) for the ISRO-ARIES Collaboration on the Aditya-L1 Project ([AL1SC](https://al1ssc.aries.res.in/past_members)).
